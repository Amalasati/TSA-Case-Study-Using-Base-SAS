# TSA-Case-Study-Using-Base-SAS

# About Data
The data for this project is stored in a CSV file called "TSA Claims 2002 to 2017," which was created by combining TSA claims data and FAA airport facilities data. The CSV file contains over 220,000 rows and 14 columns. The important columns for analysis are Claim_Number (claim identifier), Incident_Date, Date_Received, Claim_Type (type of claim), Claim_Site (location of the claim), Disposition (final settlement), and Close_Amount (settlement amount). The file also includes information about the airport where the incident occurred, such as Airport_Code, Airport_Name, County, City, State (two-letter state code), and Statename (full state name). The Item_Category column won't be used in this case study due to varying values over the years.

# scenario
The TSA is responsible for the security of the traveling public in the US. Claims are filed when travelers experience injuries or lose/damage their property during the airport screening process. The available data covers claims filed from 2002 to 2017.
